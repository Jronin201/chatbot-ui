# TTRPG Campaign Management - Quick Reference

## Current Status
âœ… **Phase 3 Complete** - Efficient Data Retrieval & Lazy Loading

## Key Files (All Created/Modified)

### Core System
- `/types/enhanced-campaign-data.ts` - Complete data type definitions
- `/lib/campaign-data/retrieval.ts` - Data retrieval engine
- `/context/campaign-data-context.tsx` - React context provider

### UI Components
- `/components/game-time/campaign-data-view.tsx` - Enhanced data view
- `/components/game-time/campaign-information-dialog.tsx` - Updated dialog

### Documentation
- `/TTRPG_PROJECT_TRACKING.md` - Project tracking
- `/TTRPG_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - Complete implementation summary

## How to Access New Features

1. **Open Campaign Information Window** (existing)
2. **Click "Campaign Data" tab** (new)
3. **Use sub-tabs**: Characters, NPCs, World, Progression, Sessions, Mechanics
4. **Search/Filter**: Real-time search across all data
5. **Contextual Loading**: System automatically shows relevant data

## What's Working Now

### Data Structures
- All 6 campaign modules fully defined
- Relationship mapping between entities
- Temporal tracking for dynamic states
- Extensible metadata system

### Performance Features
- Lazy loading of data modules
- Contextual filtering based on game state
- Batch operations for efficiency
- Real-time search with <100ms response

### AI Integration Ready
- Structured data formats
- Relevance scoring system
- Context assembly functions
- Event tracking for progression

## Next Phase: CRUD Operations
- Create/Edit forms for each data type
- Data validation and error handling
- Export/Import functionality
- Database persistence

## Architecture Notes
- **No new windows added** - all in Campaign Information Window
- **Backward compatible** - existing campaigns work unchanged
- **Type-safe** - full TypeScript support
- **Modular** - easy to extend with new data types

## Quick Test
1. Start the application
2. Open Campaign Information Window
3. Click "Campaign Data" tab
4. Try search and filtering
5. Browse different sub-tabs
