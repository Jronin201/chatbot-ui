## How to Access New Features

1. **Open Campaign Information Window** (existing)
2. **Click "Campaign Data" tab** (enhanced)
3. **Use sub-tabs**: Overview, Characters, NPCs, World, Progression, Sessions, **AI Context**, Search Results
4. **Session Management**: Start/stop sessions, track active entities
5. **AI Context Generation**: Generate context packets for different scenarios
6. **Search/Filter**: Real-time search across all data
7. **Contextual Loading**: System automatically shows relevant data

## What's Working Now

### Session State Management
- Track current session with active characters and NPCs
- Monitor current location and recent events
- Session start/stop controls with duration tracking
- Event tracking for actions, dialogue, and combat

### Contextual Memory System
- Generate AI context packets for different scenarios
- Relevance scoring for data importance
- Dynamic context assembly based on current session state
- Memory storage and retrieval system

### AI Context Generation
- **Session Start**: Overview of current campaign state
- **Dialogue**: Context for character interactions
- **Combat**: Battle-focused information
- **Exploration**: Location and discovery context
- **Character Focus**: Detailed character information
- **Location Focus**: Comprehensive location data

### Performance Features
- Lazy loading of data modules
- Contextual filtering based on game state
- Batch operations for efficiency
- Real-time search with <100ms response
- Memory caching for frequently accessed data

### AI Integration Ready
- Structured data formats for AI consumption
- Context packet generation for focused AI prompts
- Event tracking for campaign progression
- Relevance scoring for information prioritization
- Copy AI context to clipboard feature

## Next Phase: Advanced Features
- CRUD operations for editing campaign data
- Data persistence and migration
- Advanced AI integration features
- Real-time collaboration support

## Architecture Notes
- **No new windows added** - all in Campaign Information Window
- **Backward compatible** - existing campaigns work unchanged
- **Type-safe** - full TypeScript support
- **Modular** - easy to extend with new data types and context types
- **Performance optimized** - lazy loading and efficient caching

## Quick Test
1. Start the application
2. Open Campaign Information Window
3. Click "Campaign Data" tab
4. Try "Start Session" button
5. Navigate to "AI Context" tab
6. Test context generation buttons
7. Try search and filtering
8. Browse different sub-tabs

## Session Management Features
- **Session Controls**: Start/stop sessions with game time integration
- **Active Entity Tracking**: Monitor characters, NPCs, and factions in current session
- **Event Logging**: Automatic tracking of actions, dialogue, and combat
- **Memory System**: Store and retrieve relevant session memories
- **Context Generation**: Create AI-ready context packets for different scenarios

## AI Context Types Available
- `session-start` - Campaign overview for session beginning
- `dialogue` - Character interaction context
- `combat` - Battle scenario information
- `exploration` - Location and discovery context
- `character-focus` - Detailed character information
- `location-focus` - Comprehensive location data
- `general-query` - Flexible context for any query
