# Game Time AI Integration - Time Change Features

## Overview
Enhanced the Game Time system with automatic AI-powered campaign updates whenever the in-game date changes. The AI now intelligently updates Campaign Notes and Key NPC information based on time progression.

## New Features

### 1. Automatic Campaign Notes Updates
- **Trigger**: Whenever in-game time changes (any time passage ≥ 1 day)
- **Function**: `updateCampaignNotes()` in `GameTimeAIIntegration`
- **Behavior**: 
  - Reads existing campaign notes
  - Incorporates recent chat context
  - Adds time-progression-specific notes
  - Intelligently condenses content to fit token limits
  - Preserves important historical information

### 2. Automatic NPC Status Updates
- **Trigger**: Whenever in-game time changes
- **Function**: `checkAndUpdateNPCsForTimeChange()` in `GameTimeAIIntegration`
- **Behavior**:
  - Reviews each existing NPC
  - Generates time-appropriate status updates
  - Considers timeframe (days/weeks/months/years)
  - Updates based on context and established NPC traits

### 3. Smart Time-Based Processing
- **Component**: `TimeChangeHandler` class
- **Features**:
  - Categorizes time passage (immediate, short-term, medium-term, long-term, extended)
  - Generates appropriate AI prompts for each timeframe
  - Provides timeframe-specific considerations
  - Extracts relevant context from recent chat messages

## Implementation Details

### New Files Created
1. **`lib/game-time/time-change-handler.ts`**
   - Main handler for time change events
   - Generates context-aware AI prompts
   - Manages timeframe categorization

2. **`scripts/test-time-change-integration.ts`**
   - Test script to verify integration
   - Validates all components work together

### Enhanced Files
1. **`lib/game-time/ai-integration.ts`**
   - Added `updateCampaignNotes()` method
   - Added `processTimeChange()` method
   - Added time-based content generation functions

2. **`lib/game-time/campaign-tool.ts`**
   - Extended to support "notes" field updates
   - Updated function signatures and interfaces

3. **`lib/game-time/ai-middleware.ts`**
   - Added `processTimeChangeForCampaign()` function
   - Enhanced AI instructions for time awareness
   - Added support for `[CAMPAIGN_UPDATE]` tags

4. **`lib/game-time/game-time-service.ts`**
   - Integrated automatic campaign updates in `updateGameTime()`
   - Integrated automatic campaign updates in `setGameTime()`

## How It Works

### Time Change Detection
1. User updates game time through any method (manual, automatic, or AI-assisted)
2. `GameTimeService.updateGameTime()` or `GameTimeService.setGameTime()` is called
3. Time change is recorded as a `TimePassageEvent`
4. `processTimeChangeForCampaign()` is automatically triggered

### AI Processing
1. **Campaign Notes Update**:
   - Analyzes time passage duration and context
   - Generates appropriate progression notes
   - Considers consequences of recent events
   - Merges with existing notes using smart condensation

2. **NPC Status Update**:
   - Reviews each existing NPC
   - Generates time-appropriate status changes
   - Considers NPC traits and recent interactions
   - Updates relationships and circumstances

### Smart Condensation
- **Token Limits**: 
  - Character Info: 800 tokens (~3200 characters)
  - Key NPCs: 600 tokens (~2400 characters)
  - Campaign Notes: 400 tokens (~1600 characters)
- **Prioritization**: Preserves important information (names, stats, relationships)
- **Intelligent Merging**: Combines old and new information contextually

## Timeframe Considerations

### Daily (1+ days)
- Immediate consequences and daily activities
- Healing from injuries or illnesses
- Travel progress and destinations
- Simple task completion

### Weekly (7+ days)
- Recurring events and routines
- Market restocking and economic changes
- Relationship and mood changes
- Short-term project completion

### Monthly (30+ days)
- Seasonal changes and major events
- Significant life events (births, deaths, marriages)
- Training and skill development completion
- Political and social developments

### Yearly (365+ days)
- Long-term consequences and world changes
- Character aging and major life transitions
- Completion of epic storylines
- Societal and cultural shifts

## AI Integration Points

### Function Calling
- **Tool**: `update_campaign_info`
- **Fields**: `characterInfo`, `keyNPCs`, `notes`
- **Actions**: `replace`, `append`, `update`

### Response Tags
- `[CHARACTER_UPDATE]...[/CHARACTER_UPDATE]`
- `[NPC_UPDATE]...[/NPC_UPDATE]`
- `[CAMPAIGN_UPDATE]...[/CAMPAIGN_UPDATE]`

### Context Injection
- Campaign context automatically injected into every AI prompt
- Time-aware instructions provided to AI
- Current game state always available for reference

## Benefits

1. **Persistent Campaign Memory**: AI maintains awareness of campaign progression
2. **Automatic Updates**: No manual work required for time-based changes
3. **Context Awareness**: Updates consider recent events and established lore
4. **Token Efficiency**: Smart condensation prevents context window overflow
5. **Continuity**: Maintains narrative consistency across time jumps
6. **Scalability**: Handles any timeframe from hours to years

## Testing

The integration has been tested and verified to work correctly:
- ✅ AI Integration instances created successfully
- ✅ Time Change Handler functioning properly
- ✅ AI prompt generation working
- ✅ Timeframe categorization accurate
- ✅ Integration points connected correctly
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful

## Usage

The system works automatically - no user intervention required. When time changes in-game:

1. Campaign notes are updated with progression effects
2. NPC statuses are reviewed and updated as appropriate
3. All changes are intelligently condensed and saved
4. AI maintains awareness of these updates in future interactions

This creates a truly dynamic and persistent campaign world that evolves with time passage!
