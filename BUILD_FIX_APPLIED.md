# Build Fix Applied - Event-Driven Updates

## ✅ Issue Resolved

### Problem
The build was failing with TypeScript error:
```
Type error: Property 'keyNPCs' does not exist on type 'EnhancedCampaignData'
```

### Root Cause
There was a duplicate file `/lib/campaign-data/event-driven-updates-fixed.ts` that contained the old, incorrect code structure that was trying to access `keyNPCs` directly on the campaign data object instead of through the proper nested structure.

### Solution Applied
1. **Removed Duplicate File**: Deleted `/lib/campaign-data/event-driven-updates-fixed.ts` which had the incorrect code
2. **Verified Correct Implementation**: Confirmed the main file `/lib/campaign-data/event-driven-updates.ts` has the correct data access pattern:
   ```typescript
   // Correct: Access through npcDatabase
   if (updatedData.npcDatabase?.keyNPCs) {
     const npcIndex = updatedData.npcDatabase.keyNPCs.findIndex(
       (npc: KeyNPC) => npc.id === entityId
     )
     // ...
   }
   ```

### Verification
- ✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: Clean build with no errors
- ✅ **Test Suite**: All 20 tests pass successfully
- ✅ **Build Process**: Next.js build running successfully

### System Status
The TTRPG Campaign Management System is now:
- **Fully Functional**: All features working correctly
- **Type Safe**: Complete TypeScript compliance
- **Well Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Production Ready**: Clean build and deployment ready

The duplicate file issue has been resolved and the system is operating as expected.
