# TTRPG Campaign Management Enhancement Project

## Project Overview
Implementing a modular, scalable TTRPG campaign management system that can handle complex campaign data without overwhelming the AI.

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Design Modular Data Structures ✅ (COMPLETED)

- [x] Define schemas for all modules
- [x] Create TypeScript interfaces
- [x] Plan integration with existing Campaign Information Window
- [x] Update Campaign Information Window UI to display new modules

### Phase 2: Implement Modular Data Storage (Next)
- [ ] Create CRUD utilities for each module
- [ ] Implement JSON/YAML storage system
- [ ] Set up version control for campaign data
- [ ] Create migration utilities

### Phase 3: Develop Efficient Data Retrieval ✅ (COMPLETED)
- [x] Implement contextual loaders
- [x] Create dynamic retrieval functions
- [x] Add batch processing capabilities
- [x] Implement relevance scoring
- [x] Create campaign data context provider
- [x] Build enhanced campaign data view component

### Phase 4: AI Integration (Planned)
- [ ] Create context assembly functions
- [ ] Implement event-driven updates
- [ ] Add automated campaign progression tracking
- [ ] Optimize AI prompts for modular data

## Key Design Decisions

### Storage Format
- **Initial**: JSON files for prototyping (easier to debug and modify)
- **Future**: Database migration for production (SQLite or PostgreSQL)

### UI Integration
- **Approach**: Enhance existing Campaign Information Window with new tabs
- **Constraint**: No new windows, all information accessible in Campaign Information Window

### Data Modules
1. **Character Profiles (PCs)**: Basic info, attributes, development, inventory, relationships
2. **NPC Database**: Key/Minor NPCs, factions, dynamic status
3. **World State**: Locations, politics, economy, culture
4. **Campaign Progression**: Main/subplots, timeline, consequences
5. **Session Logs**: Summaries, decisions, emergent storylines
6. **Mechanics/Rules**: House rules, challenges, active mechanics

## Current Status

- **Files Modified**:
  - `/types/enhanced-campaign-data.ts` (created - contains all new interfaces)
  - `/types/game-time.ts` (modified - added reference to enhanced data)
  - `/components/game-time/campaign-information-dialog.tsx` (modified - added Campaign Data tab with modular display)
  - `/lib/campaign-data/retrieval.ts` (created - comprehensive data retrieval system)
  - `/context/campaign-data-context.tsx` (created - React context provider for campaign data)
  - `/components/game-time/campaign-data-view.tsx` (created - enhanced UI with search/filter/contextual loading)
  
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Create storage utilities for new data structures
  2. Implement data migration from current system
  3. Create CRUD operations for each module
  4. Implement AI context assembly functions

- **What's Now Available**:
  - Complete modular data structure definitions
  - Updated Campaign Information Window with new "Campaign Data" tab
  - Six sub-tabs for different data modules (Characters, NPCs, World, Progression, Sessions, Mechanics)
  - Contextual data loading system with relevance scoring
  - Dynamic search and filtering capabilities
  - Batch processing for data operations
  - React context provider for campaign data access throughout the app
  - Enhanced UI with real-time search, filters, and contextual summaries
  - Backward compatibility maintained with existing campaigns

## Notes
- All changes must be visible in the Campaign Information Window
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing campaigns
- Focus on AI-friendly data structures that can be easily parsed and understood
- Prioritize modular design for future scalability
